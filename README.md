## Information for College Board
The code that I am using that is not a part of the standard library are:

rand:
https://crates.io/crates/rand</br>
piston_window:
https://crates.io/crates/piston_window</br>
piston2d-opengl_graphics:
https://crates.io/crates/piston2d-opengl_graphics</br>
find_folder:
https://crates.io/crates/find_folder

**** NOTE ****</br>
Rust has a really small standard library so it is common to 'import' others code</br>
for more information about this read this:</br>
https://users.rust-lang.org/t/rust-should-have-a-big-standard-library-and-heres-why/37449</br>
it talks about making rust have a larger standard library and the creaters of the</br>
language shut this down listing the reasons for not having a large library.

Also refer to this to learn some more about cargo (the package manager for rust)</br>
https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html

Cargo is a convention and is standard even though I am taking code from a third party source</br>
it is standard.

The only asset that I used in this code is a font:

FiraSans-Regular.ttf:

## Setup and run
Install rust:</br>
https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install</br>
be in the root directory and run:
